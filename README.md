# Machine-Learning
This repository contains all the programming work done by Ian Feekes (ianfeekes@gmail.com) for the University of San Diego MS. Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program's Machine Learning class.

## Module 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
This assignment's notebook runs exploratory data analysis on credit default data and makes a guess at the top 10 variables correlated with the target variable of defaulting on loans.

## Module 2 - Decision Tree Classifier and Decision Tree Forest
This assignment's notebook performs decision-making predictions on the credit loan default dataset with decision tree classifiers and decision tree forests

## Module 3 - Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering
This assignment's notebook examines the art of dimensionality reduction via unsupervised learning methods like PCA and K-Means clustering.

## Module 4 - Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
This assignment's notebook performs data cleaning and balancing methods along with feature engineering in order to manually reduce dimensionality and generate most meaningful data within the dataset.

## Module 5 - Naive Bayes GBT
This assignment's notebook leverages Naive Bayes to improve performance accuracy from the Gradient-Boosted-Tree

## Module 6 - Hidden Markov Models
This assignment's notebook buidls hidden markov models to leverage time-series data to improve performance accuracy from the Gradient-Boosted-Tree

## Module 7 - Final Project
This assignment shows how to explain and engineer each portion of the Machine Learning pipeline in order to present a business case to leadership and correctly build models for production environments.
